Hello! I'm Bharath, a Software Engineer living in Bangalore. I'm a part of the Product Engineering team at Branch(https://branch.io) working on the core linking platform which is responsible for all the Branch links in the wild. 

In the past, I've built Ascend(an app which lets you send articles to Kindle), worked at Nestaway(India's largest home renting platform) and co-founded Genie(now acquired by Dunzo).
